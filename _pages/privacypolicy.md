# Privacy Policy for Friends (for Spotify)

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in "Friends (for Spotify)" for iOS.

Avi Wadhwa built the “Friends (for Spotify)” app as an Open Source and Free Application. This SERVICE is provided by Avi Wadhwa at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at “Friends (for Spotify)” unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

The app does not use any third-party services.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with anonymous unique identifiers. These are stored on your device’s internal memory under Apple’s encrypted “Keychain”. These “cookies” are not shared anywhere. The app may use third-party code that stores these “cookies”. You are able to deny or refuse the storing of cookies, however you may not be able to use the application without cookies.

## Security

Thank you for trusting us and providing us your Personal Information. I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Cookies for authentication are stored under the Apple Keychain encryption and are unreadable from anywhere other than the application.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2024-02-23
